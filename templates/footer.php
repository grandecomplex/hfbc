      <h3>Our Talks &amp; Hackathons</h3>
      <p>Hack for Big Choices is a non-profit organization driven by volunteers and financially supported by sponsors. Our main purpose is to ignite desire in young professionals and help them to change the world. We will inspire and empower them through a series of talks and hackathons on every continent.</p>
 
<p>Hack for Big Choices is designed to give to communities and individuals of any background/education/profession the opportunity to team up and put their talents to use during a two-day hackathon and solve global problems that affect their cities and or countries. </p>
<p>Through a series of talks from pioneers, thought leaders and experts who share their expertise and insights on how they have impacted the world, we stimulate conversations around some large problems currently affecting our society today in three areas: design & technology, education and healthcare.</p>

<p>We bring together young professionals in developing and those in developed countries, provide free knowledge and an online platform where all can view the talks translated into their native languages and keep the discussions ongoing through smart group chats.</p>
