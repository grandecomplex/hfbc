      <h3>Our Talks &amp; Hackathons</h3>
      <p>Hack for Big Choices is a non-profit organization driven by volunteers and financially supported by sponsors. Our main purpose is to ignite desire in young professionals and help them to change the world. We will inspire and empower them through a series of talks and hackathons on every continent.</p>
 
<p>Hack for Big Choices is designed to give communities and individuals of any background, education, or profession the opportunity to team up and put their talents to use during a two-day hackathon solving global problems that affect their cities and countries. </p>
<p>Through a series of talks from pioneers, thought leaders and domain experts we stimulate conversations around large "real-world" problems currently affecting our society in three areas: design & technology, education and healthcare.</p>

<p>We bring together young professionals in developing and developed countries, providing free knowledge and an online platform where all can view the talks translated into their native languages to keep the discussions ongoing through smart group chats.</p>
