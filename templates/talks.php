              <p>Dr. David Agus one of Steve Jobs's oncologists and has been talking to Steve Jobs nearly every day for years. Doctor David's approach is radical, and it goes against the grain of traditional western medicine. As a professor of medicine and engineering and a leading cancer physician, he says that the focus of his profession needs to shift from understanding to controlling diseases. His suggestions in the book are like algorithms for a life style, because he gives advice on how to prevent and postpone illness rather than cure it. David Agus wants people to die of old age rather than cancer or Alzheimer’s, and the only way we can do that, he thinks, is by living healthy lives for our individual and often complex bodies. </p>

He is currently working on the topic of non-networked water supply and sanitation in Mozambique and Haiti. He has been working on a large rural water improvement impact evaluation in Nampula, Mozambique. He specifically studies the caloric energy women expend when carrying water. Additionally, Kory and fellow WHD member Sebastien Tilmans are Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Explorations Grantees pursuing extremely low-cost sanitation business, service and product development in Haitian slums (Integrated Mobile Sanitation Solutions in Peri-urban Settings: Haiti, re.source).

Kory was born and grew up in Oregon till the age of 10 and still considers it home. He lived in Texas, North Carolina and the Ukraine before moving to Papua New Guinea for four years. After graduating from Ukarumpa International Secondary School, he went on to receive a BS in Environmental Biology and MS in Environmental Science from Taylor University. His research focused on dialectic variations in the Florida Scrub Jay female hiccup call and was conducted in Florida, primarily at Canaveral National Seashore. After completion of his studies he joined the Peace Corps and served as a Biology teacher in Mozambique for two years. He then extended his service for a third year as the Peace Corps Volunteer Leader for Project Development, where he performed financial oversight, assisted in planning and helped realize several nationwide projects that focused on women’s empowerment, skills training, HIV prevention and science education.

Kory is an EPA Star Fellow. He also received a 2009-2010 James H. Polhemus Fellowship, a 2010-2011 FLAS Fellowship in Portuguese, a Stanford University Center for African Studies 2011 Summer Fellowship and a 2011-2012 Rotary District Fellowship."))
